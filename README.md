# WebScraping
All my projects and learnings on WebScraping. 

## [Naukri Jobs WebScraping](https://github.com/d-saikrishna/WebScraping/tree/master/NaukriJobs):

This code will scrape across all the job domains - accounting, interior designing etc.; loop across all the pages in each of the job links - and finally extract information about all the job postings. Due to computing and internet limitations, the results presented are only a sample result. Nevertheless, the code is scalable and provided with good internet connection and computing power, it will extract lakhs of jobs posted on the website.
